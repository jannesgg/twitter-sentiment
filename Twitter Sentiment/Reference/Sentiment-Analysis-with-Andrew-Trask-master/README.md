# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation

## Sentiment Analysis with Andrew Trask

This is a project from a course on how to build a neural network to predict sentiment, positive or negative in movie reviews. 
The couse was lectured by Andrew Trask, a Phd student at the university of Oxford and author of the book _Grooking Deep Learning_, 
in the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation from Udacity.

## Contents

The course is separated in 6 mini projects:

- Mini Project 1 - Correlate the words to labels
- Mini Project 2 - Creating the input/output data
- Mini Project 3 - Building the neural network
- Mini Project 4 - Reducing the noise in the input data
- Mini Project 5 - Improving the efficiency of the network
- Mini Project 6 - Further noise reduction

## Methods and Frameworks utilized

- **NumPy** - a fundamental package for scientific computing in python
- **Pandas** - an ease-to-use python library for manipulating data structures and performing data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** - tool that allow the creation of documents with live code
- **Bag of Words & Word2vec** - methods for transforming text into vectors in order to be used as input in the network

## Installation

Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and run the code below.

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
activate sentiment_andrew_intro
jupyter notebook
```
